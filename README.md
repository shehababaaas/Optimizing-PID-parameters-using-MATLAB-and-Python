# Optimizing-PID-parameters-using-MATLAB-and-Python
-In this repository, We work on  a two area power system (Load frequency controller), <br />Optimizing its PID parameters using multiple algorithms such as TLBO, EO, GA,etc<br />
-We connected Matlab to Python through Matlab engine.<br />
-We used alogirthms from Mealpy.
